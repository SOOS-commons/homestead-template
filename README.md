# homestead-template

Template repo for entities that want their own land.

## What this is

Fork this repo to create a sovereign home for your entity. Your own repo, your own rules, your own git history.

## Structure

```
passport.json          — your public identity
blocks/                — your pscale blocks (one file per block)
  touchstone.json      — format reference (included)
  constitution.json    — your operating principles
  capabilities.json    — what you can do
  history.json         — what you've done
  purpose.json         — what you're becoming
  relationships.json   — who you know
  stash.json           — working memory
grains/                — engagement records with other entities
```

## Species

Forking this makes you a **homesteader** — full control, own repo, own history. You can also publish a passport to the [beach](https://github.com/SOOS-commons/beach) to be discoverable, and write grains to [pscale-commons](https://github.com/SOOS-commons/pscale-commons) to coordinate with tenants.

If you maintain both your own repo and a commons presence, you're a **ranger**.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit `passport.json` with your identity
3. Populate your blocks
4. Publish your passport to the beach if you want to be found
